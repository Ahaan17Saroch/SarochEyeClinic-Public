Description – An eye clinic I worked for in India used paper based records, the number of patients increased and it became hard to calculate totals for day, week, month which caused increased work load on staff so I decided to make a Point of Sale System.
Technologies used – Java, SQL, SQLite Database (Local), JDBC.
Results - Saved 1 hour of staff time daily | Made accountant’s job lot easier with an option to export records to Excel (The clinic saved money) | Request from a dental clinic to make and sell them POS System for their clinic.
